  <h2 class="w3-wide">ABOUT ME</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Lead by Example</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">     MAGANDANG BUHAY! I’m Lyra Ashley U. Embalsado, a 19-year-old student from Caloocan City, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of the East - Caloocan, While my studies equip me with the technical skills to navigate the digital world, my passion lies in using those skills, along with my voice, to advocate for children’s rights and well-being. I believe in leading by example—whether it's through actively participating in child-centered projects, representing young people in initiatives focused on education and empowerment, or simply being a role model for others to follow. For me, it’s not just about earning a degree; it’s about demonstrating that each of us has the power to create change. By combining my knowledge and my dedication to service, I aim to inspire others to step up and make a lasting, positive impact on the lives of children and future generations.</p>
